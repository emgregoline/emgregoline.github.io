At the height of the Cold War and fearing nuclear war or other catastrophe, Henderson built and lived in underground homes in Colorado and Las Vegas, Nevada. The home in Las Vegas is a 16,500 square foot home with magnetic doors that he built to be bomb-proof and earthquake-proof while also having creature comforts such as a swimming pool, putting green and guest house. When his friend, recording artist Johnny Mann, released At the bottom of the fair, he wrote on the back side of the album, 'The first time I was in an underground home was in the Colorado Rockies under a mountaintop 9500 feet above sea level! And it was here that I met the owner, Mr. Jerry Henderson. As his guest, I soon became aware of the fantastic possibilities of underground living, and at the same time struck up a lasting personal friendship with Jerry.'</p> </body");
